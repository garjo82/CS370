Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I created a neural network model that found the best route through a maze to find the treasure at the end. Most of the code that determined the setup of the maze and how the intelligent agent would move through it was pre-written. My contribution was to set up the code that allowed the intelligent agent to learn how best to move through the maze and how to eventually do so quickly.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create computer programs and software that make the lives of people and society better as a whole. These programs might increase security or resources, or just free up time for people to do other tasks.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Figure out what the requirements are to solve the problem and determine what aspect of computer science would best fulfill those requirements, then design and implement that solution.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Everything created must ultimately benefit the end user in some way, and by extension society. Improper implementations of these solutions could harm the users, create liability problems for organizations, and even lead to widespread societal issues such as with the spread of misinformation.
